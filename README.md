# Managing Packages with NPM
npm (Node Package Manager), is a command line tool to install, create, and share packages of JavaScript code written for Node.js. There are many open source packages available on npm, so before starting a project, take some time to explore so you don't end up recreating the wheel for things like working with dates or fetching data from an API.

In this course, you'll learn the basics of using npm, including how to work with the package.json and how to manage your installed dependencies.

## How to Use package.json, the Core of Any Node.js Project or npm Package
When you are done, make sure a working demo of your project is hosted somewhere public. Then submit the URL to it in the Solution Link field.

The package.json file is the center of any Node.js project or npm package. It stores information about your project, similar to how the head section of an HTML document describes the content of a webpage. It consists of a single JSON object where information is stored in key-value pairs. There are only two required fields; name and version, but itâ€™s good practice to provide additional information about your project that could be useful to future users or maintainers.

If you look at the file tree of your project, you will find the package.json file on the top level of the tree. This is the file that you will be improving in the next couple of challenges.

One of the most common pieces of information in this file is the author field. It specifies who created the project, and can consist of a string or an object with contact or other details. An object is recommended for bigger projects, but a simple string like the following example will do for this project.
